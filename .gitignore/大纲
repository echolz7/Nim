Me:
Thesis: The documentary Project Nim is subjective.

Claim 1: The documentary has strong personal orientation.

Elaboration and evidence: the documentary was the recall of the participants instead of nim’s growth. Even the participants are indeed actors and actresses.
Claim 2: The documentary self-proclaim that chimps are likely to forgive.

Elaboration and evidence: Nim was a chimp who cannot articulate his feelings that humans can understand and after suffering a miserable life, it is uncertain whether he would forgive.
Claim 3: Any documentary on animals is about people to some extent.

The presented difference between chimps and people let us reflect on our own so-called human nature.
CounterClaim: The documentary present the whole process of the experiment to us, it is kind of objective.
Rebuttal: The cold-blooded and brutal nature of human nature towards animals is wholly revealed, it is kind of satire.

Conclusion: The documentary is not a truly objective one.

论文: 《尼姆的纪录片》是主观的。

索赔1：纪录片有强烈的个人取向。
详细说明和证据：这部纪录片是对参与者的回忆，而不是对尼姆的成长。甚至连参与者都是演员。

索赔2：纪录片自我宣称黑猩猩很可能会原谅。

详细说明及证据：尼姆是只黑猩猩，他不能表达出人类能够理解的感情，在经历了痛苦的生活之后，他是否会原谅还不得而知。
索赔3：任何关于动物的纪录片在某种程度上都是关于人类的。
黑猩猩和人类之间呈现的差异让我们反思自己所谓的人性。

目标：这部纪录片向我们展示了整个实验过程，是一种客观。
辩驳：人性对动物的冷血和残忍的本性是完全揭示的，它是一种讽刺。

结论：纪录片不是真正客观的。
Me:
How did the film makers manipulate the materials? Claim 2 does not state an opinion but a fact. In claim 3, to what extent? Too ambiguous. And the rebuttal doesn't refute the counterclaim and they are talking about the different things. Last question, what is a documentary supposed to be like? Any findings from your library research?
Me:
电影制作人是如何操纵这些材料的？第2项索赔陈述的不是一个意见，而是一个事实。在索赔3中，在多大程度上？太暧昧了。而反驳并没有反驳反诉，而是在谈论不同的事情。最后一个问题，纪录片应该是什么样的？你的图书馆研究有什么发现吗？
